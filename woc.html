<h3>WOMEN OF COLOR</h3>
    
<button class="accordion">Bertha Parker Pallan</button>
<div class="panel">
    <h3>(1702-1782)</h3>
    <h4>The first Native-American Archaeologist</h4>
    <img src="images/bparkerpallan.jpg" height="400" width="300">
    
    <p>Anne Bonny and Mary Read became two of the most famed pirates. James Bonny, a nothing too special pirate and sailor, married Anne in 1718. Anne quickly grew to dislike her husband and caught the eye of Pirate Calico Jack Rackham. Calico offered to buy Anne from her husband, but with a rejected offer they snuck out at night and began a life of piracy. Anne fought in men’s clothing and was often considered just as dangerous as any male pirate. She didn’t have to conceal her gender with shipmates, but disguised herself when pillaging or in armed conflicts. She was fearless and an expert with a pistol, and often fought alongside another famed female pirate of the time, Mary Read.

    <h3>(1775-1844)</h3>
    <h4>Pirate Princess of the China Sea</h4>
    <img src="images/cshih.jpg" height="350" width="250">
    <p>The origins of the pirate Ching Shih are somewhat unclear, as even her name Ching Shih only means “widow of Cheng”. Before her husband died, he commanded the Red Flag pirate fleet, which Ching Shih would later take up. He died unexpectedly, and she took control of the family business which included the entire fleet of over 1,800 ships and an estimated 80,000 men. This made her more successful than most of the famous pirates of the time like Blackbeard who had a mere 4 ships and 300 men. She unified the fleet using a code of laws, which was often strict. She made sure that women were never mistreated, and some of her laws created punishments for rape and ensured that men would respect their wives in marriage or again be punished. Under her leadership, the Red Flags became unstoppable. Qing dynasty officials, the East India Company, and the Portuguese navy all attempted to vanquish the fleet, but it remained undefeated. After making enough money to settle down, she was pardoned by the Chinese Government and could retire unpunished and with a notorious reputation.

<button class="accordion">Soraya Tarzi</button>
<div class="panel">
    <h3>(1412-1431)</h3>
    <h4>The Queen of Human Rights</h4>
    <img src="images/starzi.jpg">
    <p>Queen Soraya ruled Afghanistan from 1919-1929. But, she wasn’t like most queens. She fought for girls education, took off her veil in public, and participated in hunting parties on horseback.  
After ridding Afghanistan of British rule, she would enstate new laws with her husband that included forbidding child marriage, making burqas optional, abolishing slavery and torture, and making all religions welcome. Soraya and her husband became an unstoppable team as they set out to modernize Afghanistan. She also became the minister of education with a mandate to educate girls and sent many to Universities abroad. As an advocate for women, she founded progressive magazines, encouraged women to enter politics, and started an all-female secret service to monitor abusive men in relationships. She caused a lot of controversy through the fact that she would go out with her husband in public to things like cabinet meetings, visits to military conflict zones, and parades. This was extremely frowned upon at the time, but Soraya had been brought up more progressively and became the first in many different aspects for a slowly modernizing culture. In 1927 and 1928 she and her husband visited Europe, and were met with open arms. The king and queen received honorary degrees from Oxford University and the queen was able to speak to a large group of teachers and leaders.

<div class="panel">
<h3> (1840-1889)</h3>
    <h4>“The Apache Joan of Arc”</h4>
    <img src="images/hlacks2.jpeg">
    <p>Lozen, a Chihenne Chiricahua Apache warrior and medicine woman and military strategist, had a gift for riding and shooting and was interested in fighting and medicine even when she was younger. She had no interest in the domestic affairs and roles of the Apache women, and wanted to learn the ways of the warrior. She was an ally to the famous Geronimo, and had a sense of how to plan attacks and anticipate where the enemy would be or direction of attack. She often prayed to the highest Apache deity of creation for guidance, which is one of the reasons why she is compared to Joan of Arc. Lozen fought with her brother Victorio, a tribe leader, to protect their people from the U.S. government trying to steal their territory. Her brother writes that she was his “right hand, strong as a man, braver than most, and cunning in strategy. Lozen is a shield to her people.” In 1870, the Apache were driven out of their lands and onto reservations. Yet, Lozen and other members of her tribe kept fighting.

<div class="panel">
<h3>(1847-1868)</h3>
 <h4>A Somali-American and proud, state legislator</h4>
    <img src="images/iomar.jpg" height="400" width="300">
    <p>Nakano Takeko both taught and belonged to a female samurai class of Japan, called the Onna-Bugeisha. Her mentor, Akaoka Daisuke, taught her martial arts, literature, mathematics, and more that were not common to women at that time. 1868 brought a civil war between the ruling Shogunate and the western-supported Meiji Imperial Government who wanted to regain control of Japan. This war broke out and was known as the Boshin War. Even after the shogun surrendered, fighting continued. Since she couldn’t officially join the army as a woman, Nakano led a troop of all women samurai fighters against the Imperial Army, to later be called the Onna-Bugeisha. The women fought primarily with the naginata, a Japanese pole-arm that allows the bearer to even the odds when fighting against bigger opponents.

    <button class="accordion">Mary Mcleod Bethune</button>
<div class="panel">
 <h3>(1875-1955)</h3>
 <h4>An Activist and Educator for All</h4>
    <img src="images/mmcleod.jpeg" height="400" width="300">
    <p>Born to former slaves on July 10, 1875, Mary Mcleod Bethune became one of the most important African-American educators, women’s and civil rights advocates, and presidential advisors to set the tone for today’s leaders. The college she founded set standards for today’s HBCUs (historically black colleges and universities) and the role she played as an advisor to Franklin D. Roosevelt gave her a voice to advocate for civil rights. She benefitted from efforts to educate African-Americans after the war, and graduated from a boarding school in North Carolina in 1894. Mary wanted to become a missionary, but since no church was willing to sponsor her, she decide to become an educator. After her marriage ended, she needed a job to support her son, and decided to found and open the Daytona Beach Literary and Industrial School. This was at first an all-girls boarding school school set up to improve education for women of color, but eventually became a college that merged with the all-male Cookman institute to form the Bethune-Cookman College. She believed that education was the key to racial advancement, and lived by this. As an advocate for women’s and civil rights, she founded many organizations and led voter registration drives after women gained the right to vote. As a close friend of Eleanor Roosevelt, she became the advisor to the president on minority affairs in 1935. She was also a leader of FDR’s unofficial “black cabinet.”  In 1936, she became the director of the Division of Negro Affairs of the National Youth Administration where she would help young people find job opportunities. She became a trusted friend and adviser to both the president and Eleanor Roosevelt.
