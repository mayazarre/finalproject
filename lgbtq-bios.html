    <h4> The Woman who Overcame Through Art </h4>

    <p>Frida was born to a German father and Mexican mother.  Kahlo contracted polio at age six and at 10 had spina bifida, which was a disease that affected leg and spine development. This isolated her from other children and caused her not to build many friendships. Many years later, Frida was on a bus in Mexico City and involved in a life-altering accident. The bus crashed into a streetcar and a handrail impaled Frida. During recovery, Frida would often paint or sketch to pass time or keep her mind off the pain. Her Dad encouraged her to keep practicing and perfecting her art skills. Frida regained some mobility and began her career as an artist. Frida admired Diego Rivera  and looked up to him. Diego also encouraged her work and believed in her. They often traveled to many places to show their work. Frida has had her work presented in San Francisco, Paris, and many more. She is known around the world for her fearlessness and her talent.
